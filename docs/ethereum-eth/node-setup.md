# Setting up an Ethereum Node

Running your own Ethereum node gives you direct access to the network and ensures you're not relying on third-party services.

## Types of Nodes

### Full Node
A full node downloads and validates every block and transaction in the blockchain.

**Pros:**
- Complete network validation
- Maximum security and decentralization
- Can serve data to other nodes

**Cons:**
- High storage requirements (1TB+)
- Significant bandwidth usage

### Light Node
Light nodes download only block headers and request specific data when needed.

**Pros:**
- Lower storage requirements
- Faster sync times
- Good for mobile devices

**Cons:**
- Relies on full nodes for data
- Less contribution to network security

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: 4+ cores
- **RAM**: 16GB
- **Storage**: 2TB SSD
- **Network**: Broadband internet

### Recommended Requirements
- **CPU**: 8+ cores
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **Storage**: 4TB NVMe SSD
- **Network**: Stable broadband with unlimited data
