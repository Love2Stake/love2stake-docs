# Ethereum Staking Basics

Ethereum transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in 2022 with "The Merge". This guide covers the fundamentals of ETH staking.

## What is Staking?

Staking involves locking up ETH to help secure the network and validate transactions. In return, stakers earn rewards.

### Requirements

- **Minimum Stake**: 32 ETH
- **Validator Software**: Consensus client + execution client
- **Hardware**: Dedicated machine or VPS
- **Uptime**: 24/7 operation recommended

## Types of Staking

### Solo Staking
Run your own validator with 32 ETH.

**Advantages:**
- Full control and sovereignty
- Maximum rewards
- Direct contribution to decentralization

**Disadvantages:**
- High technical complexity
- 32 ETH requirement
- Slashing risk

### Staking Pools
Pool your ETH with others to reach the 32 ETH threshold.

**Popular Staking Pools:**
- Lido Finance
- Rocket Pool
- Coinbase
- Kraken

### Liquid Staking
Stake ETH while receiving a token representing your staked position.

## Rewards and Penalties

### Rewards
- **Base Rewards**: For participating in consensus
- **Tips**: Transaction fees from blocks you propose
- **MEV**: Maximal Extractable Value (optional)

### Penalties
- **Inactivity Leak**: For being offline
- **Slashing**: For malicious behavior (rare but severe)

## Getting Started

1. **Education**: Learn about consensus mechanisms
2. **Hardware**: Set up your staking infrastructure
3. **Software**: Install execution and consensus clients
4. **Deposit**: Send 32 ETH to the deposit contract
5. **Monitor**: Keep your validator healthy

## Security Considerations

- Keep your withdrawal keys offline
- Use a hardware wallet for key generation
- Implement proper backup procedures
- Monitor your validator performance
- Stay updated with client software
