# Introduction to Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Development was crowdfunded in 2014, and the network went live on July 30, 2015.

### Key Features

- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code
- **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**: Applications that run on the Ethereum network
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**: The runtime environment for smart contracts

## Getting Started

Before diving into Ethereum development or staking, it's important to understand the basics:

1. **Wallets**: How to store and manage ETH
2. **Gas Fees**: Understanding transaction costs
3. **Consensus Mechanism**: Proof of Stake (PoS)
