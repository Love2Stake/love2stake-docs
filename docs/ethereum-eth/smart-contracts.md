# Smart Contracts on Ethereum

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## What are Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts are programs that automatically execute, control, or document legally relevant events according to the terms of a contract or agreement.

### Key Characteristics

- **Autonomous**: Execute automatically when conditions are met
- **Transparent**: Code is visible on the blockchain
- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed once deployed (unless designed with upgrade mechanisms)
- **Decentralized**: No single point of control

## Programming Languages

### Solidity
The most popular language for Ethereum smart contracts.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 private storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

### Vyper
A Python-like language focused on security and auditability.

```python
# @version ^0.3.0

stored_data: uint256

@external
def set(x: uint256):
    self.stored_data = x

@view
@external
def get() -> uint256:
    return self.stored_data
```

## Development Tools

### Framework Options
- **Hardhat**: Comprehensive development environment
- **Truffle**: Mature framework with testing suite
- **Foundry**: Fast, portable toolkit written in Rust
- **Remix**: Browser-based IDE

### Testing Tools
- **Mocha/Chai**: JavaScript testing frameworks
- **Waffle**: Ethereum-specific testing utilities
- **Foundry Test**: Built-in testing with Forge

## Gas and Optimization

### Understanding Gas
Gas is the unit that measures computational effort required to execute operations.

**Gas Optimization Tips:**
- Use `uint256` instead of smaller uints when possible
- Pack struct variables efficiently
- Use events instead of storage for logging
- Implement efficient algorithms

### Common Patterns
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Prevent reentrancy attacks
- **Pull over Push**: Let users withdraw funds rather than sending automatically
- **Circuit Breaker**: Add emergency stops to contracts

## Security Considerations

### Common Vulnerabilities
- **Reentrancy**: Recursive calls during execution
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+
- **Front-running**: MEV and transaction ordering attacks
- **Access Control**: Improper permission systems

### Best Practices
- Follow established patterns and standards
- Conduct thorough testing and audits
- Use established libraries (OpenZeppelin)
- Implement proper access controls
- Consider upgrade mechanisms carefully

## Deployment Process

1. **Write Contract**: Develop and test locally
2. **Compile**: Generate bytecode and ABI
3. **Test**: Deploy to testnets (Goerli, Sepolia)
4. **Audit**: Security review (for important contracts)
5. **Deploy**: Send to mainnet
6. **Verify**: Upload source code to Etherscan

## Popular Use Cases

- **DeFi**: Decentralized finance protocols
- **NFTs**: Non-fungible token standards (ERC-721, ERC-1155)
- **DAOs**: Decentralized autonomous organizations
- **Gaming**: Blockchain-based games and virtual worlds
- **Identity**: Self-sovereign identity solutions
